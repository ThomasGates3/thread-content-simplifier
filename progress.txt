ARCHITECTURE:
- Frontend (React + Tailwind) → Backend (Express.js in Docker)
- Backend → Local Ollama (Mistral model, ~4GB cached)
- Docker connects via host.docker.internal to Mac's Ollama service
- Single Docker service: threads-backend on port 5555

HOW TO RUN:
1. Ollama already running: `brew services list | grep ollama` (should show "started")
2. Start Docker: `docker-compose up -d` (from project directory)
3. Open: http://localhost:5555
4. Use the app immediately (model cached from previous setup)
